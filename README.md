# Retail Sales Prediction

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and resources for predicting retail sales using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical sales data and build models that can forecast future sales for retail businesses.

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, ensemble methods)
- Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, etc.)
- Prediction and result analysis

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bibas06/retail-sales-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks and start exploring!

## Folder Structure

- `notebooks/`: Main Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and modeling
- `data/`: Sample and processed datasets
- `models/`: Saved model files (if any)
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Usage

1. Load the datasets in the notebooks.
2. Run through the cells to preprocess data, build models, and make predictions.
3. Adjust parameters and experiment with different algorithms to improve accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (see `requirements.txt` for full list)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or submit pull requests for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features.
